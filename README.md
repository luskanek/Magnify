Magnify is a World of Warcraft (1.12) add-on which allows the user to zoom the world map in or out.

Other changes include:
- The world map player arrow has been replaced with a high-res texture.
- The old ping animation has been removed and instead the player arrow will flash for a brief duration upon opening the map.

You can type `/magnify` in the in-game chat to access several customization options.

The zoom feature is backported code from retail with several adjustments to make it work with the Vanilla client.
