Magnify is a World of Warcraft (1.12) addon with its main feature being world map zoom. Along with this functionality, several changes have been applied to the world map frame:

- The world map player arrow has been replaced with a hi-res texture.
- It is now possible to set the scale of the player arrow.
- A new flash animation was added in place of the default ping animation that would play upon opening the map.

The zoom feature is backported code from retail with several adjustments to make it compatible with the Vanilla client.
